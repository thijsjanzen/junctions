#' Individual Based Simulation of the accumulation of junctions
#' @description Individual based simulation of the accumulation of junctions
#' for a chromosome with regularly distributed markers.
#' @param pop_size Population Size
#' @param freq_ancestor_1 Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0
#' @param morgan Mean number of crossovers per meiosis (e.g. size in Morgan of
#' the chromosome)
#' @param total_runtime Maximum time after which the simulation is to be stopped
#' @param seed Seed of the pseudo-random number generator
#' @param R Number of regularly distributed markers
#' @return \item{avgJunctions}{vector of the average number of junctions at
#' time = [0, total_runtime]}
