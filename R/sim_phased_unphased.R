#' Individual Based Simulation of the accumulation of junctions
#' @description Individual based simulation of the accumulation of junctions,
#' returning phased and unphased data. Ancestry on both chromosomes of 10
#' randomly sampled individuals per generations is returned.
#' @param pop_size Population Size
#' @param freq_ancestor_1 Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0
#' @param total_runtime Maximum time after which the simulation is to be stopped
#' @param size_in_morgan Mean number of crossovers per meiosis (e.g. size in
#' Morgan of the chromosome)
#' @param markers If a single number is provided, the number is used as the
#' total number of markers generated either randomly, or using a regular
#' distribution (a regular distribution is chosen if the number is negative). If
#' a vector is provided, that vector is used.
#' @param time_points vector with time points at which local ancestry has to be
#'  recorded to be returned at the end of the simulation. If left at -1,
#'  ancestry is recorded at every generation (computationally heavy).
#' @param num_threads default is 1. -1 takes all available threads.
#' @param verbose displays a progress bar
#' @param record_true_junctions keep track of the true number of junctions?
#' @param num_indiv_sampled the number of individuals sampled at each time point
#' to be genotyped
#' @param use_explicit if TRUE, only ancestry at the markers is simulated. If
#' FALSE, all junctions are simulated.
#' @param coverage fraction of markers that can be succesfully phased
#' @param error_rate fraction of markers that are erroneously
#' phased (e.g. swapped)
#' @return a tibble with five columns: [time, individual, marker location,
#'                             ancestry chromosome 1, ancestry chromosome 2]
