\title{Function to simulate data using a back crossing scheme}
\usage{
sim_backcrossing(population_size = 100, freq_ancestor_1 = 0.5,
  total_runtime = 5, size_in_morgan = 1, number_of_markers = 100,
  seed = 6, time_points = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{population_size}{Population size}

\item{freq_ancestor_1}{Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0}

\item{total_runtime}{Number of generations to simulate}

\item{size_in_morgan}{Mean number of crossovers per meiosis (e.g. size in Morgan of the chromosome)}

\item{number_of_markers}{number of molecular markers}

\item{seed}{Seed of the pseudo-random number generator}

\item{time_points}{vector with time points at which local ancestry has to be
recorded to be returned at the end of the simulation. If left at -1, ancestry is recorded at every generation (computationally heavy).}
}
\value{
List with five entries: average_junctions: average number of junctions over time, detected_junctions: average number of detected junctions, given the markers. markers: vector with the locations of the molecular markers, junction_distribution: distribution of junctions per time step average_heterozygosity: average heterozygosity.
}
\description{
Individual based simulation of the accumulation of junctions,
under a back crossing scheme

\examples{
vx <- sim_backcrossing(population_size = 100,

                       time_points = 1:5)
