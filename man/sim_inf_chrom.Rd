\title{Individual Based Simulation of the accumulation of junctions}
\usage{
sim_inf_chrom(
  pop_size = 100,
  freq_ancestor_1 = 0.5,
  total_runtime = 100,
  morgan = 1,
  markers = -1,
  seed = 42
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop_size}{Population Size}

\item{freq_ancestor_1}{Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0}

\item{total_runtime}{Maximum time after which the simulation is to be stopped}

\item{morgan}{Mean number of crossovers per meiosis (e.g. size in Morgan of
the chromosome)}

\item{markers}{The number of genetic markers superimposed on the chromosome.
If markers is set to -1, no markers are superimposed (faster simulation)}

\item{seed}{Seed of the pseudo-random number generator}
}
\value{
\item{avgJunctions}{vector of the average number of junctions at
time = [0, total_runtime]}
}
\description{
Individual based simulation of the accumulation of junctions
for a chromosome with an infinite number of recombination sites.
