\title{log likelihood of the time since admixture for a haploid genome}
\usage{
log_likelihood_haploid(ancestry_matrix, N = 1000, freq_ancestor_1 = 0.5, t = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Population Size}

\item{freq_ancestor_1}{Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0}

\item{t}{time since admixture}

\item{ancestry}{matrix with 3 columns, column 1 = chromosome, column 2 =
location in Morgan, column 3 = ancestry.}
}
\value{
loglikelihood
}
\description{
log likelihood of the time since admixture for a set of single
chromosomes (for ex. in Yeast).
