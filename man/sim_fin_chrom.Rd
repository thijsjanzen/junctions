\title{Individual Based Simulation of the accumulation of junctions}
\usage{
sim_fin_chrom(pop_size = 100, freq_ancestor_1 = 0.5,
  total_runtime = 100, morgan = 1, seed = 42, R = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop_size}{Population Size}

\item{freq_ancestor_1}{Frequency of ancestor 1 at t = 0}

\item{total_runtime}{Maximum time after which the simulation is to be stopped}

\item{morgan}{Mean number of crossovers per meiosis (e.g. size in Morgan of the chromosome)}

\item{seed}{Seed of the pseudo-random number generator}

\item{R}{Number of regularly distributed markers}
}
\value{
\item{avgJunctions}{vector of the average number of junctions at time = [0, total_runtime]}
}
